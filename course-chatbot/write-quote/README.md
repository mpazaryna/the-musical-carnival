# Exercise 2: Write a File and Read it

If you’re going to be building chatbots you’re going to need to learn to read and write data from the filesystem. It’s one of the basic tasks of [knowledge orchestration](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/a-few-things-i-believe-about-ai).

Let’s start with a simple string:

“Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible. — Victor Frankl”

Please start a new repl in Replit and do the following:

- Write that string to a file using Python. Call the file, “quote.txt”
- Read that string from the file and print it out to the console

Are you stuck? Ask ChatGPT to help. I gave you an example prompt in Exercise 1—so try using something like that to help you get started.
