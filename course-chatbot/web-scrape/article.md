The first thing I asked Replit founder, Amjad Masad, is whether he‚Äôd still
want his kids to learn to code.

Amjad is both a long-time programmer, and the founder of Replit‚Äîthe newest AI
unicorn. They're a web-based development environment that announced this week
that they raised almost $100m dollars at a $1.6B valuation from a16z and a
host of other top investors. They‚Äôve built a Github CoPilot competitor, called
GhostWriter, and part of their mission is to give every programmer an AI team
member that can write code for them.

So, I wanted to know, does programming still matter?

He told me that he believes that the leverage on programming skills has gone
way up in the last year. He thinks that the current generation of AI tools are
inherently _augmenting_ tools, not _automating_ tools. They might change the
bundle of skills you need to be a programmer‚Äîyou might act more like a guide
or a manager in many instances than writing code yourself. But he believes
that programming skills actually become _more_ important in an AI-driven
world. So yes, he still wants his kids to learn to code.

In other words: even though he could‚Äîand even though maybe he should‚ÄîAmjad
isn‚Äôt blindly banging the AI drum.

He actually struck me as one of the few people in the space who has the right
level of excitement. Replit has been prototyping AI tools for the last 3-4
years, long before they were popular. So Replit isn‚Äôt a Johnny-come-lately
entrant into this space. Instead he‚Äôs someone who believes deeply in the long
term potential of the technology, but can also acknowledge its significant
present limitations. He does a good job of not swinging between poles of mania
or doom, and I left the interview feeling grounded, and smarter.

We covered his thoughts on two big topics: the future of programming, and how
startups can win against incumbents in the AI race. The second is something
Amjad knows a lot about too. Replit‚Äôs going up against Microsoft in a quest to
own how you build software with AI. And so, they‚Äôre facing the biggest
question every single one of today‚Äôs startups has to face: how do you build
and win with an AI product against a better funded incumbent that also has
access to AI?

Amjad has a plan. Read on to learn more.

## Amjad introduces himself

Hi, I‚Äôm Amjad. I'm originally from Jordan‚Äîborn and raised there. I came to the
US in 2012 to work at Codeacademy in New York. I was a founding engineer
there. I actually built one of the first open source in-browser coding
sandboxes while I was there, so that's the predecessor to Replit. I was
obsessed with this idea of making programming easier to get started with and
more fun. I wanted to make hacking easy, so you can have an idea and build it
fast, instead of needing to plan a lot and set up a big development
environment. It's been my obsession over my career to just make programming
more fun and accessible.

I worked at Codeacademy in New York for a while, then joined Facebook. At
Facebook I worked on the React team and then was one of the founding engineers
on React Native, and built the entire JavaScript runtime and compiler tool
chain. I brought the same ideas to React: fast feedback loops, fast updates,
and refresh. I wanted you to be able to work on it as if you're working in a
sandbox. In 2016, I went back to browser-based coding and started Replit as a
company with my wife Haya, who's our head of design now. And we pursued the
same mission: just make programming more fun and accessible.

## The importance of learning to code in the AI era

Learning how to code becomes more important in a world with AI.

AI means that the return on investment from learning to code just went way up.
AI models are great at generating code, but they go off the rails easily.
They‚Äôre inherently statistical and stochastic, so they make a lot of mistakes.
That will get better asymptotically, but for the foreseeable future, they‚Äôll
need human input.

That means in this new world, you can suddenly build incredible things by
leveraging these tools to generate code. And, if you can program, you can
understand where they‚Äôre getting things wrong and fill in the gaps.

You become less of a traditional programmer and more of a guide to bring your
ideas to life. These are inherently augmenting technologies, not automating
technologies.

Another way to say this is that these models are really good as copilots. And
I think that will create deflationary pressure in the environment where
individual companies may need fewer programmers. So it will have a significant
impact on productivity from that perspective.

That doesn‚Äôt mean that we‚Äôll need fewer programmers overall though. I think
we‚Äôre far away from automating programming completely, even though autonomous
agents are popular right now. The problem with autonomous agents is that the
errors they make compound. Each time the LLM gets called there‚Äôs a certain
amount of errors, and by the time they get to the 10th loop on something
they‚Äôre very likely to have gone off the rails.

The whole trend in software development over the last 70 years is towards more
predictability in terms of output. And so using autonomous agents where
there‚Äôs inherent unpredictability seems unlikely to me. They‚Äôre just not smart
enough for that right now.

I think this is something that‚Äôs missed in the larger conversation around AI.

## AI doom is bullshit

We are now in a vicious cycle of hype and fear where the incentives of the
players involved make the cycle extremely bipolar.

On the one hand AI labs are incentivized to oversell their models‚Äô
capabilities. Take Microsoft for example‚Äîthey put out a paper titled ‚ÄúFirst
Contact With AGI‚Äù talking about GPT-4 (which they later renamed ‚ÄúSparks of
AGI‚Äù). Of course, that‚Äôs not science, it‚Äôs content-marketing. But when people
read that and predictably freak out about it, Microsoft goes and says, ‚ÄúOh no,
you‚Äôre overreacting.‚Äù

On the other hand you have people who built their entire identity on freaking
out about AGI, and the louder they freak out the more attention and funding
they attract. So they‚Äôre incentivized to also overstate the capabilities. Then
the labs benefit indirectly from the fear caused by doomers because they can
raise more money on bigger valuations, and attract talent that feel like
they‚Äôre working on existential problems. And that makes doomers freak out
more. So there‚Äôs a perverse incentive to hype this technology and make it seem
like superintelligence is just around the corner. The reality is, we‚Äôre very
far from that.

GPT-2 to GPT-3 was the birth of a new technology. But GPT-3 to GPT-4 is an
incremental jump. GPT-4 has less hallucination, it‚Äôs more predictable, it has
a bigger context window‚Äîbut it‚Äôs just technical incremental improvement. We‚Äôre
really hitting diminishing returns on the current architecture of these
models.

If you just look at the way these models are today, you‚Äôll see that they‚Äôre
going to have a very difficult time impacting the physical world enough to end
humanity. Sure, if you connect GPT-4 to the US nuclear arsenal it could cause
massive damage, but no one is going to do that. Even if you postulate the
intelligence of these models greatly advancing, they‚Äôre still going to run
into physical limits.

Mastering tasks in the real world requires considerable trial and error. While
doomsday scenarios often depict AI as an omnipotent entity, such a notion
inherently creates issues. However, if we consider AI as an extremely
intelligent being, it will still face challenges with simple tasks, like
lifting a cup of coffee. Over time, it can learn to accomplish this.Even then,
there are a lot of real-world scenarios that are inherently computationally
intractable that AIs will run into trouble trying to control. People miss
that.

One of the great tragedies of modern times is that we inherited this world, we
didn‚Äôt build it. People of the last century, who lived through the industrial
revolution, knew how hard it was to build things in the physical world. But
we‚Äôve mostly lived in a world that was built for us, so we forget how hard it
is to do.

We understand how to build the virtual world, and it‚Äôs possible AI will get
very good at that. But the physical world is a different story. I think
forgetting that distinction leads to all sorts of thinking about being able to
dominate the world and the physical space that is not realistic because we
don't really have an intuition for how hard it is.

People were way undershooting on the potential of AI for a long time, and now
they‚Äôre way overshooting. There‚Äôs a bipolar nature to markets like this. It‚Äôs
something you have to come to terms with if you want to build companies.

Overall though, it‚Äôs super exciting to see so much progress. Especially in
open source. You want to focus on the builders, and put the hype or the doom
aside. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs most exciting.

## How startups can use bundling and vertical integration to win in AI

We were fairly early to AI-powered development. We built a lot of GPT-2 and
GPT-3 based code generation and code explanation experiments back in 2020. And
then we productized that as GhostWriter last year, which is our CoPilot-like
AI assistant‚Äîbut it also has an AI chat and can do things in the programming
environment, understands your projects, understands your output and more.

I‚Äôve been in the space for a long time, so I have a few thoughts on how
startups and startup builders can win in AI.

The inherent benefit of Replit is that we bundle and vertically integrate the
entire toolchain and lifecycle of software development. We help our users go
from idea, to an end product that you can see and share with friends, to a
deployment that you can share with the world. We‚Äôre even building in tools to
help developers monetize what they build.

So we‚Äôre taking people from idea to dollar. We want to bring the distance
between those two things to as close to zero as possible.

Most development tools are not built this way. If you‚Äôre VS Code, you can‚Äôt do
this. You have to support every use case under the sun. You have to support
every idiosyncratic way that your users are used to doing things, so you can‚Äôt
bundle and vertically integrate.

But our approach allows us to see the entire lifecycle of software
development, which gives us a fundamental advantage. For example, Ghostwriter
will soon be able to know your entire history of deploying to your app, and
see all of the logs from users using it in the wild. Because it sees the
entire process, it will be able to make coding suggestions for you to build
features or fix bugs based on how your users are using your app.

So vertical integration becomes a superpower for us. It‚Äôs technically possible
for Microsoft to build that, but it‚Äôs extremely hard because their customers
aren‚Äôt specifically asking for that. They‚Äôre not asking for bundling and
vertical integration, most of them want less bundling and more customization.

There are other good examples of this. One is Tesla.

Yesterday, I was in San Francisco and I wanted to drive back to South Bay
where we live. And I put in our address, and I didn‚Äôt have enough battery to
get there. The Tesla automatically added the address of a Supercharger station
that‚Äôs on our way home, and it used self-driving to get me there.

The vertical integration of the car, the AI, and the physical power station
created this incredible experience. It allows Tesla to suck at a lot of things
‚Äì like build quality issues ‚Äì but because they can provide an unparalleled
end-to-end experience they win.

This type of bundling and vertical integration is something I‚Äôd recommend
startups who want to build in AI think about as a strategy. It takes a certain
type of founder who is very focused and able to do it for a really long time
in order to build something like this.

It‚Äôs super hard. It will nearly kill you. And you can‚Äôt go for the vertical
integration and bundling right out of the gate. There were a lot of startups
founded around the time of Replit that tried to do this, and they all died. A
few of them raised big seed rounds, and burned through it for five years, and
closed the company.

You can‚Äôt get too ambitious too fast. What we did is we built a toy version of
the complete thing.

When we first started the company I expected the product would be powerful
enough within a year that we could code Replit with Replit. But we just
started getting to the point where that‚Äôs possible‚Äîso it took a few years.

At first it was very useful for students. So, it was a toy for the lower end
of the market, and then you keep making it better and more complete over time.

Building a toy is helpful because it allows you to ship. You create progress
for people like investors or talent to see, and it allows you to tell if
you‚Äôre building something people find useful. Whereas if you‚Äôre hiding in a
corner somewhere, even if you have infinite capital, it‚Äôs really hard to have
the willpower to keep going.

This stuff is important, but I don‚Äôt think founders should over-strategize.
Just build something useful and get it into the hands of people. You want to
think strategically, but don‚Äôt do it so early on that the magnitude of the
challenge depresses you.

## A book recommendation

This book has come as close as any other book in history to predict the
massive change the information revolution will have. It predicted many things
we're just experiencing‚Äîfrom AI lawyers to Bitcoin
