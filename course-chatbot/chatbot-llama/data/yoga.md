## Assisting and Relationship

Like a great dance, assisting requires an awareness of the other person every moment. We first must check in with our beings so we come into a relationship with clarity.

What is it that we are up to? When you offer support and express the desire. You need to know where you are moving and know your intention.  

You own all of your projections, all of your communications. You are projecting upon people a particular ideal. What do you want to communicate at each moment? Pull back the misperceptions. We are approaching a whole history of a person on the mat; they are carrying the information. When you adjust the shoulder, what are you trying to do?

Clarify the intention of why you're providing support and express this teaching to another person. What is this practice trying to offer?

How are we communicating with how we walk, talk, and move through the yoga studio? Go on a journey of awareness with your understanding of yourself and the person you support.

Get as straightforward as possible with the student before you go in for the adjustment.

When you approach a body, that person has an entire history—the family dynamics. Listen carefully to the whole story.  Own your account; you are constantly projecting onto somebody your own story.  Talk to the students about what you can learn from them.

If you assist, you must clear off your energies; it's very taxing.  Find things that are available for you to recharge and keep going.

## Zero Fix-It Philosophy

We are all in this human experience; we have parts that are strong and parts that are wounded. As yoga teachers, we start to see what's beyond what the eye can see in the student's body. We need to find out where people are in their stories. We are meeting them in a unique moment. They have their journey and arc, just as we are in our own story.  

Assisting is more than just about the external. What it is to have a moment of interaction with the students. Then the need to do a bunch to do lots of things falls away.

You don't need to fix it, and it's not helpful to take it on. Open the aperture of your eyes, and see more clearly the experience—no attachment to the outcome of the class. No fruits of your labor; this is the Gita moment. Show up and give what you have to offer, and no more.  

Lack of proprioception is a familiar feeling among students, where "is my body in space."  

>No fixing, that's it, maybe just a few tips along the way.

## Exploring Connection with Mark

Mark works with the energy and trauma that's held in the body. What are you dragging in the body that we've inherited? We hide to stay safe; that happens in our early years. We are not taught to take care of our temple; we're prepared to care for everybody else before us. We try to avoid suffering and pain through distractions, addictions, concealment, and escapism (yoga workshops, yoga training). We can hide anywhere.

You're not just touching somebodies body; you're touching lives and maybe a dash of trauma. It's our responsibility to do the work; if we don't, it's the responsibility of the kids to do the job. Holding off until we're aware is a good thing to do with having a family.

When we change our behavior, we abandon the little trauma kid inside. We must come in through the back door when trying to change that behavior, and if you're not careful, the roots will go deeper. 

> The part you hate about yourself is how you learn how to love yourself.  

Mark wants the trigger to happen; it's the alchemy to bubble things up and deal with them.

Honor all the hard things, which is opposite to the "magic pill" culture that we live in. Help people feel their pain.  

## Practice in Connection

This exercise will require a partner. This video offers a view into the practice of connecting. Stand, relax your body, and connect with the breath. Gaze into your partners' eyes without an agenda.

One person then closes their eyes, and the other puts their hand in front of their heart without touching it. After a few breaths, place your hand gently on their sternum. 

Both of you now open your eyes. 

Now the other person closes their eyes, and the other person places their hand over the heart of the person with their eyes closed, without touching.  

> We all have a Gollum hiding inside us, the scared little boy and the little girl.  

## Self Trust and Wisdom

> Wisdom arrives through the assimilation of suffering

The "yoga mat" is your life; it is a microcosm. What do you need right now? Trust yourself in this innate bodily knowing. The tears are your tears; the "picking up of" negative emotions may want to be reviewed; it's all you.

Anger/frustration on the mat, coming out of pushing yourself past the safety line, that's when you can get hurt. Stay in the question and be in the moment.

Touch lightly in the foot to ground somebody down into the foundation.

> Our wound is where our superpower comes from; it is how we evolve.  Judgment is the soil in which discernment sprouts.

## Assisting as a Service

Offer support for the whole practice. It's not just about being the teacher in the front of the room. Break the veils of the interactions of the day.  

## Responses to Assists

The longer a practitioner has been around, the more complex the assist. We are having a dance with humans.  

## Attraction, Gender, and Intention

Two versions of "it" (accidental mishap or brush in a spot). The other is a misinterpreted touch, malicious touch, or inappropriate touch. The student may go into a space of past trauma—the weight of it on the person that received it.  

Attraction can come in many forms. "Pretty practice, dressed nicely." 

Always check yourself before you go in for hands-on support. Take care and concern, be present, and be clear about what you're doing in the assist.

## Assisting as a Relationship

How do you "physicalize" oneness? We are creating a space for individuals to discover their understanding. It's straightforward; the metronome is your breath and the breath of the person you share space with. Trust that the breath will tell you that you're in integrity.

## Demo: Downward Dog

Foundation and space. Witness the feet and hands to the side of the feet to give somebody where the feet should be landing. Get the weight back and feet down. Place hands mid-thigh bone and press out in the calves and push in.  

Warrior I foundation for the teacher, lean forward and press into the lower back.

Strap across the sacrum, thread it through the legs, and then pull the strap through 

Use the hand in 3 legged dog to point the foot toward the floor. Also, from here, you can keep the hand on the foot and guide the student into a head-to-knee posture.
