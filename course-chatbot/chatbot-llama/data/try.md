### Highlights

- Wu-wei literally translates as “no trying” or “no doing,” but it’s not at all about dull inaction. In fact, it refers to the dynamic, effortless, and unselfconscious state of mind of a person who is optimally active and effective. People in wu-wei feel as if they are doing nothing, while at the same time they might be creating a brilliant work of art, smoothly negotiating a complex social situation, or even bringing the entire world into harmonious order. For a person in wu-wei, proper and effective conduct follows as automatically as the body gives in to the seductive rhythm of a song. This state of harmony is both complex and holistic, involving as it does the integration of the body, the emotions, and the mind. If we have to translate it, wu-wei is probably best rendered as something like “effortless action” or “spontaneous action.” Being in wu-wei is relaxing and enjoyable, but in a deeply rewarding way that distinguishes it from cruder or more mundane pleasures. In many respects, it resembles the psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s well-known concept of “flow,” or the idea of being in the zone, but with important—and revealing—differences that we will explore. People who are in wu-wei have de, typically translated as “virtue,” “power,” or “charismatic power.” De is radiance that others can detect, and it serves as an outward signal that one is in wu-wei.

- The goal is to acquire the ability to move through the physical and social world in a manner that is completely spontaneous and yet fully in harmony with the proper order of the natural and human worlds (the Dao or “Way”). Because of this focus on knowing how rather than knowing this or that, the Chinese tradition has spent a great deal of energy over the past two thousand years exploring the interior, psychological feel of wu-wei, worrying about the paradox at the heart of it, and developing a variety of behavioral techniques to get around it. The ideal person in early China is more like a well-trained athlete or cultivated artist than a dispassionate cost-benefit analyzer. This better fits both our intuitive sense of what real human excellence looks like and our best current scientific understanding of how the mind works. ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=323))
- The ideal person in Western philosophy is not only disembodied but also radically alone. ([Location 332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=332))
- For the past couple hundred years in the West, the dominant view of human nature has been that we are all individual agents pursuing our own self-interest, responsive only to objective rewards and punishments. ([Location 332](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=332))
- Human societies, according to this narrative, were formed when lone hunter-gatherers—typically men, suspiciously unaccompanied by their mates, children, elderly parents, or sick friends—met in a clearing, negotiated the rules they would live under, and then shook hands and agreed to cooperate. As economists and political scientists have only recently begun to realize, this is a fairy tale cooked up over the last century or two by a bunch of elite, landowning males—what the philosopher Annette Baier has scathingly referred to as “a collection of clerics, misogynists, and puritan bachelors.” ([Location 334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=334))
- In reality, we are not autonomous, self-sufficient, purely rational individuals but emotional pack animals, intimately dependent on other human beings at every stage of our lives. We get along, not because we’re good at calculating costs and benefits, but because we are emotionally bound to our immediate family and friends and have been trained to adopt a set of values that allows us to cooperate spontaneously with others in our society. ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=338))
- However, it has its own rationale, one grounded in an ancient Confucian preference for character-based, intuitive judgments over rigid rule following. ([Location 363](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=363))
- You deal with people face to face because their spontaneous expressions and casual remarks—their wu-wei behavior, the quality of the de that they emanate—tell you everything that you need to know about them. ([Location 364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=364))
- The best way to ensure that agreements are honored is to forge intense personal loyalties, typically over the course of several evenings fueled by good food and staggering quantities of alcohol. ([Location 365](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=365))
- We have been taught to believe that the best way to achieve our goals is to reason about them carefully and strive consciously to reach them. Unfortunately, in many areas of life this is terrible advice. Many desirable states—happiness, attractiveness, spontaneity—are best pursued indirectly, and conscious thought and effortful striving can actually interfere with their attainment. ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=387))
- A skilled butcher has to change his cleaver once a year, because he cuts; an ordinary butcher has to change his cleaver once a month, because he hacks. As for me, I have been using this particular cleaver for nineteen years now, and have cut up thousands of oxen with it, and yet its edge is still as sharp as when it first came off the whetstone. Between the joints of the ox there is space, and the edge of the blade has no thickness; if you use that which has no thickness to pass through gaps where there is space, it’s no problem, there’s plenty of room to let your cleaver play. That’s why, after nineteen years, the edge of my blade looks like it just came from the whetstone. ([Location 417](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=417))
- “Whenever I come to a knot, I see the difficulty ahead, become careful and alert, focus my vision, slow my movements, and move the blade with the greatest subtlety, so that the ox simply falls apart, like a clod of earth falling to the ground.” ([Location 424](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=424))
- we are Butcher Ding’s blade, and the bones and ligaments of the ox are the barriers and obstacles that we face in life. Just as Butcher Ding’s blade remains razor-sharp because it never touches a bone or ligament—moving only through the gaps in between—so does the wu-wei person move only through the open spaces in life, avoiding the difficulties that damage one’s spirit and wear out one’s body. ([Location 428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=428))
- After I have fasted for three days, concerns about congratulations or praise, titles or stipends no longer trouble my mind. After five days, thoughts of blame or acclaim, skill or clumsiness have also left my mind. ([Location 440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=440))
- “There is no more ruler or court,” he explains, “my skill is concentrated and all outside distractions disappear.” ([Location 444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=444))
- He’s ready to get to work. ([Location 445](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=445))
- Now I set off for the mountain forest to observe, one by one, the Heavenly nature of the trees. If I come across a tree of perfect shape and form, then I am able to see the completed bell stand already in it: all I have to do is apply my hand to the job and it’s done. If a particular tree does not call to me, I simply move on. All that I am doing is allowing the Heavenly within me to match up with the Heavenly in the world—this is probably why people mistake my art for the work of the spirits! ([Location 446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=446))
- The Way of Heaven Excels in overcoming, though it does not contend; In responding, though it does not speak; In spontaneously attracting, though it does not summon; In planning for the future, though it is always relaxed. The Net of Heaven covers all; Although its mesh is wide, nothing ever slips through. ([Location 460](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=460))
- the early stages of training, an aspiring Confucian gentleman needs to memorize entire shelves of archaic texts, learn the precise angle at which to bow, and learn the length of the steps with which he is to enter a room. His sitting mat must always be perfectly straight. All of this rigor and restraint, however, is ultimately aimed at producing a cultivated, but nonetheless genuine, form of spontaneity. ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=476))
- “The Master said, ‘At fifteen I set my mind upon learning; at thirty I took my place in society; at forty I became free of doubts; at fifty I understood Heaven’s Mandate; at sixty my ear was attuned; and at seventy I could follow my heart’s desires without transgressing the bounds of propriety.’ ([Location 481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=481))
- In the early Chinese accounts of wu-wei described above, a couple of features are immediately apparent. First, although there is only one Butcher Ding or Confucius in the world, these wu-wei exemplars experience themselves as split. They seem to feel a gap between an “I” (the locus of consciousness and personal identity) and various forces—spiritual desires, desires of the heart—that take over when they enter wu-wei. Wu-wei is characterized by an internal sense of effortlessness and unselfconsciousness, even though the person in wu-wei may actually be very active in the world. Someone or something else must be doing the work besides the conscious mind that we normally think of as “us.” Second, people in wu-wei are extremely effective: huge oxen fall apart with a few swipes of the blade, and complex social situations are negotiated with masterly aplomb. My guess is that we have all experienced this combination of effortlessness and effectiveness at some point in our lives. ([Location 498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=498))
- “When I first began cutting up oxen, all I could see was the ox itself. After three years, I no longer saw the ox as a whole. And now—now I meet it with my spirit and don’t look with my eyes.” ([Location 570](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=570))
- These lines appear to describe the act of “seeing” by using different parts of the self. When Butcher Ding is a complete novice, and all he can see is “the ox itself,” he is merely looking with his eyes, gazing upon this massive, daunting creature that he must somehow reduce to pieces. ([Location 571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=571))
- What this study suggests is that, in a spontaneous yet high-skill situation such as jazz improv, the ACC remains alert in the background even when the lateral PFC is turned off. This particular neural configuration may correspond subjectively to the kind of relaxed but vigilant mode we enter into when we’re fully absorbed in a complex activity. It is the ACC that is still paying attention when Butcher Ding is moving his blade effortlessly through the ox, ready to call for help if he runs into a “difficult spot.” In other words, at least some forms of wu-wei appear to involve shutting down active conscious awareness and control while maintaining background situational alertness. When your conscious mind lets go, the body can take over. ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=662))

- This social dimension of wu-wei becomes crystal clear in texts such as the Analects, where we read that Confucius always appears in the proper attire, knows the right way to enter a room, utters the most apropos words, and deals with others in the most tactful manner, and yet is never stiff or formal. His behavior seems to flow spontaneously from his very nature, which completely disarms philosophical opponents, tames ornery rulers, and shames lazy disciples into pursuing their studies with renewed effort. You can practically hear the swish and swoosh of Ding’s blade as Confucius glides through an official reception with consummate grace or deftly handles a rude interlocutor without missing a beat. ([Location 720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=720))
- In the Analects we read that “one who rules through the power of de is like the Pole Star: it simply remains in its place and receives the homage of the myriad lesser stars.” ([Location 726](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=726))
- This connection has important implications for understanding the kind of spontaneity that the early Chinese valued so highly. Spontaneity in the West is typically associated with individuality—people just doing whatever they want. Wu-wei, on the other hand, means becoming part of something larger: the cosmic order represented by the Way. Sages from Confucius at age seventy to the Daoists describe wu-wei as a state of “fitting” with the universe. Similarly, de is powerful because Heaven has made humans, animals, and even the natural world in such a way that they respond instantly and unquestioningly to virtue. ([Location 747](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=747))
- ancestors for the past few hundred years: she rises at five in the morning to milk her cows, she cooks, she cleans, she takes the herd up to higher pastures or tends to her orchards, she cards wool. When asked to describe what gives her the greatest pleasure in life, she reports that it is precisely these everyday activities that put her into a state where she is absorbed, unselfconscious, and at ease. “To be outdoors, to talk with people, to be with my animals … I talk to everybody—plants, birds, flowers, and animals,” she explains. “Everything in nature keeps you company; you see nature progress every day. You feel clean and happy.… Even when you have to work a lot it is very beautiful.” This story has little to do with complexity and challenge, still less with constantly spiraling complexity. Rather, the main sense one gets is of peaceful, relaxed absorption into something larger than the self: the natural beauty of the Italian Alps, an inherited tradition that provides routine and structure, a sense of companionship with animals and birds. These bigger wholes into which Serafina feels absorbed—Nature with a capital “N,” or her cultural tradition—are also seen by her as important sources of value or goodness. Indeed, it is the fact that she deeply cares about her beautiful surroundings and her way of life, and derives meaning from them, that allows her to become absorbed in the first place. When I first read this account, as a beginning student of Chinese thought, I recall feeling that Serafina’s experience not only looked a lot more like early Chinese conceptions of wu-wei than the endless travel and self-improvement of E. but also matched my own experience better. This is a conviction that has only strengthened over time. ([Location 784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=784))
- Except for the psychological profile of the state they produce, these activities do not look anything at all like E.’s frenetic life. Indeed, if one looks past Csikszentmihalyi’s own emphasis on complexity and challenge, the survey data that he and his colleagues have gathered suggest that most flow experiences actually occur in social situations of relatively low complexity, like conversing with friends, sharing a meal with family, or playing with small children. ([Location 808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=808))
- Why, then, did flow researchers end up focusing on complexity and challenge as the defining features of the experience? Because these researchers are, for the most part, Western individualists. In our culture, activities like running ultramarathons or exploring new art museums tend to be solitary and aimed at self-improvement. ([Location 812](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=812))
- Flow researchers also latched on to complexity and challenge because they were keen to distinguish flow states from other states that share some of the same features—loss of a sense of self, an altered experience of time, relaxation—but that we wouldn’t want to dignify with the label of “flow.” Watching a mindless TV show would be a good example, but we could include any simple, passive activity that fully occupies our attention while we are immersed in it, yet leaves us feeling empty or tired rather than fulfilled and energized: gambling, reading a trashy magazine, aimlessly surfing the Internet, or exchanging desultory gossip with acquaintances we don’t even really like. When faced with the question of how to distinguish between flow and activities such as this, complexity and challenge jump out as the salient features when considered from a purely individualist perspective. ([Location 816](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=816))
- Our consideration of the early Chinese religious worldview, however, gives us an alternate, and ultimately more satisfying, way to make this distinction. It is the connection with a larger, valued whole that allows wu-wei or true flow experiences to leave us feeling “clean and happy,” as Serafina puts it, rather than dirty and worn out. One can think of this larger whole as a framework ([Location 822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=822))
- of values—that is, a structure within which we situate ourselves or our actions and that allows us to classify some things as good and others as bad and to behave accordingly. ([Location 825](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=825))
- Understanding the essential role that these frameworks play in human life is, in turn, the key to understanding wu-wei. I would suggest that the distinguishing feature of wu-wei is the absorption of the self into something greater. ([Location 833](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=833))
- And this vacuum has to be filled by something—avoiding human rights abuses still leaves a lot of hours in the day. ([Location 864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=864))
- trafe ([Location 871](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=871))
- Confucius was convinced that no one was born graceful yet correct, and to the end of his life remained fond of rebuking anyone who thought that untutored casualness was desirable or even socially acceptable. This point is well illustrated by an Analects passage that describes Confucius’s reaction upon entering a room and being welcomed by a young man named Yuan Rang. We don’t know much about this Yuan Rang, but he seems to have been an early Chinese hippie, possibly a devotee of the Laozi we’ll meet in the next chapter. I’ve always imagined him with dreadlocks and loose robes, smelling vaguely of patchouli. Confucius enters the room and finds this guy “sitting casually, with his legs sprawled out, waiting for Confucius.” The proper attitude for receiving a guest in a situation like this would have been the formal kneeling posture still practiced by the Japanese: kneeling on a mat while sitting back on the ankles. Yuan Rang was apparently lounging with his legs stretched out or loosely folded in front of him, a position that is certainly more comfortable but rather too casual for receiving an elder such as Confucius. The Master’s response is priceless: “Upon seeing him, the Master remarked, ‘A young man devoid of humility and respect for his elders will grow into an adult who contributes nothing to his community. Growing older and older without the dignity to simply die, he becomes nothing more than a useless burden.’ He then whacked him on the shin with his staff.” ([Location 949](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=949))
- For them, wu-wei could be obtained only through a lifelong program of trying, strenuously, to distance oneself from nature and move instead toward a thoroughly cultivated kind of perfection. ([Location 965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=965))
- Another way to put this is that, despite their endorsement of spontaneity as an ultimate end goal, Confucius and Xunzi emphasized cold cognition, on both an individual and a cultural level. ([Location 970](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=970))
- Although their reliance on cold cognition might sound similar to Western rationalist philosophy, it is the Confucian emphasis on personal transformation that marks the crucial difference, as we will see. ([Location 975](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=975))
- Knowing how we in fact master a new skill, like driving a car, gives us an important insight into the wu-wei strategy pursued by Confucius and Xunzi. The Confucian Way—the rituals and knowledge passed down from the Zhou dynasty—needs to be fully absorbed by people if they are to live together in a harmonious society. The mind has the power to comprehend the Way, but this is not enough. One needs to get beyond merely understanding the Way and live it, in a fully embodied manner. Cold cognition must be made hot. The Confucians tried to accomplish this by intensively training people’s embodied minds until consciously learned processes could be performed in an wu-wei fashion, like operating a clutch or tying your shoes. ([Location 1118](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=1118))
- For instance, babies are born with an innate ability to smile in response to pleasure—a simple reflex reaction. It is not until they are a couple months old that they are able to smile at someone, in order to elicit a response or communicate happiness. Later still comes the ability to smile in response to imagined happiness (as in a story) or to the happiness of others (empathetic happiness). This process is often encouraged by stories, art, peer modeling, and literature. ([Location 1176](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=1176))
- This emphasis on tradition, authority, and collectivism goes very much against Enlightenment thinking. René Descartes, in ([Location 1197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=1197))
- his Meditations (1641), famously declared that you can’t accept as reliable knowledge what you’ve been taught in school. The only way to obtain true knowledge, he argued, is to acquire it yourself, building up logically from first principles. This is a seductive idea, and very deep-seated in our culture, but it’s almost certainly wrong. To a degree that qualitatively differentiates us from other animals, we are born incomplete, primed to learn specific types of things from our culture but absolutely dependent upon culture to provide them. We celebrate creativity and novelty but tend not to notice the extent to which any artist or business innovator has been shaped by the ideas and efforts of others, both living and dead. There is a trivial sense in which the technological magic worked by Steve Jobs, for instance, depended on preexisting technologies and ideas. There is a more profound sense in which his creativity could have emerged only from the social and cultural milieu of a particular historical moment in Silicon Valley. In this, as in many other respects, the early Confucian view of learning and thinking is probably much more accurate than the one we’ve inherited from the European Enlightenment. ([Location 1197](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=1197))
- One way to look at this privileging of ancient wisdom over individual brainpower is as a response to the dangers of uncontrolled hot cognition and the inadequacies of individual cold cognition. Because we all have limitations, the Confucians put in place a system of environmental buffers to keep us on the straight and narrow Way. ([Location 1206](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=1206))
- As we’ve seen, he would not sit unless his mat was straight, and he gives some strict advice to a disciple who asks about how to become a gentleman: “Do not look unless it is in accordance with ritual; do not listen unless it is in accordance with ritual; do not speak unless it is in accordance with ritual; do not move unless it is in accordance with ritual.” Confucius thought that social harmony depended upon people following specific cultural models in every aspect of life. ([Location 1212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=1212))
- Despite all the cultural conservatism, then, the Confucian view of civilized life is, in the end, optimistic. Sigmund Freud, to take a prominent Western counterexample, saw the tension between hot and cold cognition as the ineradicable tragedy at the heart of modern life. We were miserable in the state of nature because a world in which everyone allowed their id—their hot cognition—to run wild would be chaotic, capricious, and brutish, even for the rare individuals lucky enough to be at the top of the social pyramid. A civilized life is better for everyone overall, but it also exacts a cost: everyone is required to either repress or sublimate a large portion of their instinctual drives and to live under the iron rule of cold cognition. The result is a state of what Freud calls Unbehagen, which is usually translated as “discontent” or “dissatisfaction” but ([Location 1274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=1274))
- also includes a sense of physical unease. If you go into a weird, creepy old house and feel the hair stand up on the back of your neck at the thought of ghosts, that’s also Unbehagen. For Freud, to live as a civilized human being is to live in a creepy old house. ([Location 1280](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=1280))
- The Confucian ideal of the perfectly civilized person is thus the opposite of the Unbehagen-ridden Freud. The Confucian strategy does try to boost self-control, but mainly it tries to make cold-cognition-approved behavior more reliable by making it “natural” and spontaneous. The Confucian gentleman is perfectly at home in civilization, instead of always uneasy about it. An evocative passage from the Xunzi describes how Confucian learning can enter the aspiring Confucian and take control of his body, changing his very physiological makeup. “The learning of the gentleman enters his ear, becomes firm in his heart-mind, spreads out through his four limbs, and manifests itself in both activity and repose. In his merest word, in his slightest movement, the gentleman can always be taken as an example and a model.” At this point there is no more need for cognitive control. Every action of the gentleman is free and easy, yet perfectly correct. “The sage gives free rein to his desires and fulfills all of his emotions, but having been regulated they accord with civilized norms,” Xunzi explains. “What need has he, then, for strength of will, endurance, or cautiousness?” ([Location 1282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=1282))
- This is Confucian wu-wei. The idea of replacing problematic, innate dispositions with new, socially desirable ones seems like the perfect solution to the problem of how to get people cooperating in large societies, and in the case of Confucius himself it seems to have worked like a charm. ([Location 1292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=1292))
- The tune that Confucius was playing must have been intended by him to convey a feeling of quiet commitment and frustrated purpose. To his critic’s ear, however, it feels more like ignorant recalcitrance. If Confucius is having no success, he should not force it. He needs to stop trying to shove the Confucian Way down everyone’s throats and instead tend to his own garden. Reject technology, quit your job, ditch your fancy clothes, and head off to the countryside. If this is beginning to sound a lot like the 1960s, it shouldn’t be surprising. Swap out Standing Tall in the Marsh for Moonchild, a human-drawn plow for a homemade composting toilet, and a facility with the Odes for an ability to quote Emerson and Thoreau, and these recluses from the later strata of the Analects would find themselves right at home in 1968 Haight-Ashbury. They are, as far as we know, the original hippies, dropping out, turning on, and stickin’ it to the Man more than two thousand years before the invention of tie-dye and the Grateful Dead. These hippies don’t fare all that well in the Analects itself—as one might expect, in a book compiled by Confucius’s followers, Confucius always gets the last word. All of the “primitivist” encounters in the Analects end with Confucius justifying his refusal to take the easy way out, and with the recluses being made to look like lazy dropouts. After the encounter with the plowmen, for instance, Confucius sniffs, “A person cannot flock together with the birds and the beasts” ([Location 1400](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=1400))
- To begin with, unlike Confucius, Laozi thought that less, rather than more, culture was the answer. Confucius saw humans as fundamentally crude by nature and in need of cultivation. Laozi believed that we’re fine as we are—or at least as we were, before society messed us up. For Laozi, human nature is fundamentally good, and our innate dispositions are the ones we need to follow. Education and training are therefore entirely counterproductive, leading us away from our essential goodness. ([Location 1431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=1431))
- Moreover, the very act of socially labeling things as “beautiful” or “good,” in Laozi’s view, already distorts our natural, spontaneous judgment. One passage tells us that “when everyone in the world knows that the beautiful is ‘beautiful,’ it is then ugly.” What this cryptic claim might mean is spelled out by the rest of the passage, which argues that singling out and verbally labeling a value sets up a dichotomy that then acts as a mental trap. Laozi famously declared, “He who speaks does not know,” a motto that underlines the tendency of verbal labels to cloud our judgment and our ability to see what is right in front of us. The philosophical target, of course, is the Confucians, with their clear standards concerning the right kind of music to listen to, the right kind of clothes to wear, the right way to enter a room, and—perhaps most damaging—the precise way to be “good.” Laozi’s argument is that calling some behavior “good” ensures that it will not be good, because conscious labeling and explicit effort poison our experience.

- How do we escape it? By doing nothing. Of all the thinkers in early China, Laozi uses the term wu-wei in a sense closest to its literal meaning of “no doing.” In his mind, the energy driving the pernicious cycle of reversion is desire—another parallel to Buddhism. Desire, in turn, is created and strengthened by the two activities so fundamental to the Confucian pursuit of wu-wei: cultural knowledge and active striving. Cultured tastes and artificial needs, he argues, distort our natural enjoyment of the world, and we can counter this by keeping our food simple and our physical desires modest. ([Location 1529](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=1529))
- The clearest account of how, in Laozi’s view, conscious effort and striving are responsible for the world’s ills is a famous passage that appears halfway through our received version of the text: The highest Virtue [de] does not try to be virtuous, and so really possesses Virtue. The worst kind of Virtue never stops striving for Virtue, and so never achieves Virtue. The person of highest Virtue does not act [wu-wei] and does not reflect upon what he is doing. The person of highest benevolence acts, but does not reflect; The person of highest righteousness acts, and is full of self-consciousness. The person of highest ritual propriety acts and, when people do not respond, rolls up his sleeves and forces them to respond. Hence when the Way was lost there arose Virtue; When Virtue was lost there arose benevolence; When benevolence was lost there arose righteousness; When righteousness was lost there arose the Confucian rituals. Ritual is the wearing thin of loyalty and trust, And the beginning of disorder. ([Location 1536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=1536))
- The famous—or notorious—tennis player John McEnroe, though not to my knowledge formally trained as a Franklian psychoanalyst, intuitively perceived the power of this technique. When faced with an opponent whose forehand, for instance, was working smoothly and perfectly, McEnroe would supposedly compliment him on it as they changed sides: “Wow, your forehand is really great today.” His opponent would then, of course, suddenly start botching easy shots in the next set.

- Ironic effects are not confined to physical movements, emotions, or physiological processes like trying to fall asleep—they extend to the moral realm as well. Subjects who are explicitly instructed to be fair and unprejudiced actually become more prejudiced. Similarly, the phenomenon of “moral licensing” refers to the negative effect that positive moral self-evaluations have on a person’s subsequent behavior. Subjects allowed to establish that they are not prejudiced are more likely to exhibit prejudice in follow-up exercises. ([Location 1585](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=1585))
- One of the most striking features of the Laozi is the manner in which the metaphors it employs seem directly targeted at the metaphors that dominate the Analects. Confucius urges us to adorn ourselves with culture (wen, ), the original meaning of which is “pattern” or “decoration”; Laozi tells us to exhibit the “unadorned” and “simple.” Confucius advocates carving and polishing ourselves the way we would a fine piece of jade; Laozi tells us to embrace the “uncarved block.” Confucius compares the process of self-cultivation to a grueling, lifelong journey toward sagehood; Laozi tell us to stop, turn back, and go home to our primordial roots, to “being an infant,” or to “honoring the Mother.” Acutely aware of the potentially ironic outcomes of striving, as well as the pernicious effects of excessive self-regard, Laozi thinks that the only way to attain wu-wei is to try to mitigate the damage inflicted ([Location 1598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=1598))

- The neuroscientist Arne Dietrich has done interesting work on what he calls “transient hypofrontality,” the downregulation of the cognitive control regions in the prefrontal cortex that occurs during intense physical exercise. Vigorous physical activity puts enormous stress on the human body, and the body responds by temporarily shutting down parts deemed inessential, like our energy-hungry PFC. The cognitive state that results looks very much like the relaxed, natural wu-wei mind-set of the Laozian sage. As Dietrich observes, Some of the phenomenologically unique features of this state such as experiences of timelessness, living in the here and now, reduced awareness of one’s surroundings, peacefulness (being less analytical), and floating (diminished working memory and attentional capacities), are consistent with a state of frontal hypofunction. Even abstruse feelings such as the unity with the self and/or nature might be more explicable, considering that the prefrontal cortex is the very structure that provides us with the ability to segregate, differentiate, and analyze the environment.

- Interestingly, it appears that we get the same neurological pattern with the use of alcohol and various drugs, or a really good bout of sex, whether you prefer to play the role of the female or not. All of these activities temporarily shut down our conscious mind—our sense of awareness, orientation, and control—leaving the unconscious system in charge. When Laozi speaks of returning to the “mind of an infant,” this is, from a scientific perspective, more than just a metaphor. Laozian meditation aims to disable precisely the regions of the mind that are developed, or overdeveloped, in adulthood, allowing our more basic and ancient systems to take over. ([Location 1657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=1657))
- As in the Analects, then, there is a political dimension to this vision. The de of the Laozian sage is so powerful that it is able to draw others into its orbit. The naturalness of the sage causes others around him to become natural as well. The end goal is a world free of artifice, hypocrisy, and excess desire, where humans live in simple harmony with each other and the natural world and there is no need to talk about morality because kindness and goodness flow forth from people spontaneously, without the slightest effort or thought. ([Location 1679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=1679))
- “In the state of Song there was a man who, worried because his sprouts of grain were not growing fast enough, decided to go out to his field and pull on them. Without any idea of what he’d done, he returned home and announced to his family, ‘I am really exhausted today, I’ve been out in the fields helping the sprouts to grow!’ Alarmed, his sons rushed out to the fields to take a look and saw that all the sprouts had shriveled and died.” This episode is the basis of a modern Chinese saying, “pulling on the sprouts to help them grow,” which refers to any effort that has thoroughly counterproductive results. Mencius intends this to be a message about the proper way to attain morally correct wu-wei: “You must put some work into it, but you can’t force it. Do not be like the man from Song!” ([Location 1792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=1792))

- Although he loudly professed his commitment to Confucianism, Mencius was so deeply influenced by Laozi’s celebration of “naturalness” that he modified Confucius’s thought in fundamental ways, which is why we’ll be discussing him on his own, as opposed to lumping him together with Confucius and Xunzi. Dedicated to Confucian values, but drawn to the idea that wu-wei should spring from our innate tendencies rather than being forced upon us from the outside, Mencius formulated a unique version of Confucianism that is still very appealing today. Mencian thought attempted to chart a course between the traditionalism of Confucius and Xunzi and the radical primitivism of Laozi. Confronted with opponents who argued that the answer to the social chaos of the Warring States was for everyone to adopt ([Location 1808](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=1808))
- When it comes to being moral, you need to try, but not too hard, and in a way that does not go against your natural tendencies. You certainly don’t want to be yanking on your sprouts. ([Location 1815](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=1815))
- The goal of education should not be to teach people logic and self-control but rather to guide them in nurturing a set of positive, innate tendencies into full wu-wei dispositions. Extending the agricultural metaphor, Mencius called these tendencies the “four sprouts.” We can get a sense of what these sprouts feel like psychologically by invoking Mencius’s “child and the well” thought experiment: Now, imagine a person turning around and, all of a sudden, spotting a small child stumbling toward the opening of a deep well. There is no one who, in such a moment, would not experience a feeling of alarm and empathy. Their response would be motivated by this feeling alone—not because they want to save the child and thereby gain some merit with the parents, not because they want to gain a reputation for goodness among their neighbors and friends, and not because they want to avoid having to hear the child’s anguished cries. From this we can see that someone lacking this feeling of empathy cannot be called a proper human being. This “feeling of empathy,” Mencius explains, is the sprout that, if properly cultivated, will grow into the full virtue of benevolence or compassion. Another sprout is that of “righteous indignation,” the beginning of moral correctness: “Imagine that one is so hungry that a single plate of rice, a single bowl of soup, is the difference ([Location 1857](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=1857))
- The conscious mind, ungrounded by the wisdom of the body, is remarkably incapable of taking care of business. Damasio labels as “Descartes’ error” the idea that morality, or any human behavior, can be guided solely by disembodied reason. ([Location 1932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=1932))
- This does not necessarily eliminate the need for instruction and training. As we’ve discussed, the unconscious can be educated. We’re not born knowing how to ride a bike or drive a car. In the same way, although we appear to be born with some nascent moral feelings, the behavior of your average three-year-old suggests that additional training and practice are required to become a mature person. This is the essence of Mencius’s critique: you can’t try to consciously force morality, like the sprout-pulling Mohists, but you also can’t just sit around, listening to a Jerry Garcia solo and hoping socially desirable behavior will somehow magically follow.

- benighted, ([Location 1951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=1951))
- A dominant Laozian metaphor for naturalness is the uncarved block, a simple, unadorned, unworked chunk of wood. Mencius replaces this static metaphor with a dynamic one: nature is like a sprout that wants to grow in a certain direction, it just needs a little help. The primitive stasis that Laozi celebrates does not represent true naturalness but rather a stunting of natural human tendencies. ([Location 1952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=1952))
- The difference is that Mencius believed that we are blessed with the beginnings of morally proper wu-wei within us—the four sprouts. Although we are not spontaneously good when born, we tend toward good, in the same way that wheat sprouts will grow into mature plants if given the proper environment and care. Becoming spontaneously good involves merely developing these tendencies, under the guidance of a wise teacher, who plays the same role as a knowledgeable farmer. You need to apply fertilizer at the right times, weed when necessary, and ensure proper irrigation. ([Location 1956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=1956))
- The king needs to reflect on the way he felt when he saw the terrified ox—ruminate on it, roll it over on his moral tongue, as it were—to fully appreciate what empathy in the presence of a suffering, sentient being feels like. Then, as Mencius puts it later in the conversation, he needs to work on “taking this feeling here” (sympathy for the terrified ox) and applying it to “what is over there” (empathy for his terrified, oppressed people). ([Location 2007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=2007))
- finally finds himself able to respect and care for the commoners. “One who is able to extend his kindness in this way will be able to care for everyone in the world,” Mencius concludes, “while one who cannot will find himself unable to care for even his own wife and children. That in which the ancients greatly surpassed others was none other than this: they were good at extending their behavior, that is all.” ([Location 2014](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=2014))
- other words, we think in images. This is not to say that we necessarily think in pictures. An “image” in this sense could be the feeling of what it’s like to lift a heavy object or to slog in a pair of boots through some thick mud. ([Location 2021](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=2021))
- Here again, Mencius seems prescient. The Mohists, like their modern utilitarian cousins, think that good behavior is the result of digital thinking. Your disembodied mind reduces the goods in the world to numerical values, does the math, and then imposes the results onto the body, which itself contributes nothing to the process. Mencius, on the contrary, is arguing that changing ([Location 2046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=2046))
- your behavior is an analog process: education needs to be holistic, drawing upon your embodied experience, your emotions and perceptions, and employing imagistic reflection and extension as its main tools. Simply telling King Xuan of Qi that he ought to feel compassion for the common people doesn’t get you very far. It would be similarly ineffective to ask him to reason abstractly about the illogical nature of caring for an ox while neglecting real live humans who are suffering as a result of his misrule. The only way to change his behavior—to nudge his wu-wei tendencies in the right direction—is to lead him through some guided exercises. We are analog beings living in an analog world. We think in images, which means that both learning and teaching depend fundamentally on the power of our imagination. ([Location 2048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=2048))
- For both Xunzi and Confucius, wu-wei—the complete absence of effort—can be obtained only through an “accumulation of effort.” You pile effort on top of effort until what you’ve learned becomes so internalized the effort falls away. The process involves hard work and a complete transformation of the self; as with carving a piece of jade or wood, the end product looks nothing like what you started with. The danger with this strategy, as we noted, is that it might not work. Back ([Location 2078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=2078))

- When people are asleep, their spirits wander off; when they are awake, their bodies are like an open door, so that everything they touch becomes an entanglement. Day after day they use their minds to stir up trouble; they become boastful, sneaky, secretive. They are consumed with anxiety over trivial matters but remain arrogantly oblivious to the things truly worth fearing. Their words fly from their mouths like crossbow bolts, so sure are they that they know right from wrong. They cling to their positions as though they had sworn an oath, so sure are they of victory. Their gradual decline is like autumn fading into winter—this is how they dwindle day by day. They drown in what they do—you cannot make them turn back. They begin to suffocate, as though sealed up in a box—this is how they decline into senility. And as their minds approach death, nothing can cause them to turn back toward the light.

- This Zhuangzian wu-wei is a state of perfect equanimity, flexibility, and responsiveness. Unlike the rigid conscious mind, it can “determine right and wrong” because it doesn’t pre-determine it. Being in wu-wei is sometimes compared to being like a pivot or a hinge—the still point at the center from which one can respond to every change, every eventuality. “When ‘this’ and ‘that’ are no longer set up in opposition, this is called the pivot of the Way,” we are told. “Once the pivot is centered in its socket, it is able to respond inexhaustibly.” Another helpful metaphor is that of letting your mind be like a mirror: ([Location 2502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=2502))
- Fully embody that which cannot be exhausted and wander where there are no signs. Use to the fullest what you have received from Heaven but do not think that you have gotten anything special. Just be empty, that is all. The Perfected Person uses his mind like a mirror: he does not lead or welcome; he responds but does not store. This is why he is able to win over things and not be harmed. ([Location 2508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=2508))
- A literal mirror passively reflects what is in front of it, and when that thing changes the mirror changes as well. It does not “store” past images, nor does it anticipate images to come. It simply waits, empty and receptive. This is what the post-fast consciousness looks like, open to the world, responding directly from the unconscious mind, and overflowing with subtle, but powerful, de. ([Location 2511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=2511))
- To understand his point, take a simple economic transaction. Let’s say I promise you five chickens in return for working all week on my farm and then give you only three. If you are a purely rational agent, you’ll take the three chickens and go on your way. Why? The risk of getting killed or seriously injured in a fight is not worth two chickens. Unfortunately, in acting as a purely rational agent, you’d turn yourself into an economic punching bag. Why would I give you what I promised when I know you’ll take less and meekly slink off? Now, imagine that, instead, you are prone to righteous indignation. If I try to shortchange you on the chickens, I know you’re going to fly off the handle and do something violent—something irrationally violent. A person like you is going to tend to get the number of chickens originally promised. We no longer tend to denominate our transactions in chickens, but the logic here is identical to the Ultimatum Game we discussed earlier. If I am given $100 to split between you and me, and I offer you $1 and propose to keep $99 for myself, you will get angry and scupper the whole deal, even though the rational thing to do would be to take the $1. Dollars, chickens, whatever: Frank’s insight was that even very basic social interactions cannot work unless there are powerful emotions lurking in the background, keeping everyone honest. In this sense, emotions that seem irrational in the short term—they would result in more short-term costs than payoffs—are rational in the long term. Overall, they reduce costs. However—and ([Location 2787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=2787))
- and here’s the rub—they work only if they really are irrational and sincere. My righteous indignation is an effective deterrent only if it would actually lead to irrational violence. In other words, the long-term payoff comes only if I don’t consciously care about payoffs. Sound familiar? Frank is keenly interested in this tension and even refers to it as a “simple paradox”—one that is structurally the same as Nivison’s paradox of virtue. Our long-term interests require trust between individuals, but trust can be acquired only by those who give up the direct pursuit of self-interest. The conscious pursuit of self-interest is actually incompatible with its attainment. Similarly, in the context of civilization, moral emotions are the key to people obtaining maximum material advantage, but they work only if they are sincere. We couldn’t hope for a clearer analysis of the paradox lurking at the heart of any kind of social commitment, whether the Shang king’s willingness to take on his wife’s sickness or seven-year-old Ivy’s sincerity (or lack thereof) in feeling love for all living creatures.

- significantly improve their ability to detect false statements if suspects were asked to give their alibis in reverse order, starting with the most recent event and working their way back. This is not the way we normally tell stories, so being forced to do it increases cognitive load. Dishonest suspects, it turns out, are less effective liars if you handicap their conscious minds in this way. ([Location 2939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=2939))
- This reverse-order alibi technique is a great tool for law enforcement but not terribly practical when evaluating a potential business partner or deciding if the people you’re about to make a peace treaty with are being sincere. There are other ways to achieve the same effect, though. The police study aimed to reduce subjects’ cognitive control ability by increasing the load—adding more weight, as it were. Alternately, you can keep the load constant but decrease cognitive control ability—weaken the mental muscles—by suppressing cognitive control centers. One way to do this is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which involves applying a powerful magnetic force to the appropriate region of the skull. TMS, however, is a very recent technology and not exactly widely available. Also, in most cultures it’s considered bad form to shock the heads of new acquaintances with huge magnets. ([Location 2942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=2942))
- A much more low-tech and socially acceptable way to produce the same effect is to get someone completely wasted. As we discussed in chapter 6, one of the primary effects of alcohol and other intoxicants is to “downregulate,” or temporarily paralyze, areas of the prefrontal cortex associated with cognitive control. ([Location 2948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=2948))

    - **Note:** In this case they had to use conscious control to be honest. Lying was the automatic thing
- Looked at from a contemporary perspective, we can redescribe de as the body language that someone exhibits when their cognitive control centers are downregulated—when they are being genuinely spontaneous. Confucius advises that, when judging the character of someone, you should pay attention to their eyes, their offhand remarks, their subtle body language, especially when they think that no one else is around. If you do that, he says, “how can a person’s true character hide?” ([Location 2995](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=2995))
- The key is to see that, at the end of the day, it is not enough that a trusted member of our group is able to dance our dances, drink wine with us, and speak our language well, although that certainly doesn’t hurt. Indeed, as we’ve seen, such relatively unfakeable markers are probably very useful for quick Is he one of us? assessments. At the end of the day, though, we need more. Because of the constant danger of free riders faking commitment—putting in the time to learn our cultural skills, while secretly ready to betray our shared values as soon as an opportunity presents itself—a potential gap opens between external behavior and internal motivation. What we want, then, is a particular type of desirable, hot behavior where there is absolutely no gap between action and motivation. We want to assure ourselves that there is no extraneous cold cognition sneaking around backstage with potentially nefarious plans of its own. What we’re interested in is not mere physical skills but what philosophers call “virtues”: stable dispositions to perform socially desirable actions in a manner that’s sincerely motivated by shared values. ([Location 3038](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=3038))
- We have a powerful, ineradicable intuition that a “compassionate” action performed without the right motivation is merely a semblance, a counterfeit of virtue. The flip side is that evidence of sincerity and spontaneity in the moral realm inspires and moves us. ([Location 3066](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=3066))
- Interestingly, the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle was very much aware of this issue, which he framed in terms of a distinction between physical skills (what he called “crafts”) and virtues. When it comes to a skill like playing the piano, we have no problem imagining how forced training can eventually result in an internalized, reliable skill. ([Location 3068](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=3068))
- When it comes to a virtue like compassion, however, it’s not at all clear how training alone could work. We have an intuition that, if I don’t spontaneously feel at least some compassion for the homeless guy with the blistered feet, going through the motions of buying him new boots is not going to transform me into a compassionate person. Even if I force myself to act out compassionate behaviors hundreds of times, as if practicing scales, it’s hard to see how or when I would thereby become a genuinely compassionate person. There’s an important sense in which character virtues strike us as the kind of thing that can’t be acquired just by trying: either you have them or you don’t.

- They want to foster cooperation and virtue, not efficient butchery. So the paradox exists because the kinds of virtues that people care about and value in others center on who you are, not necessarily what you do. They are about stable, inner states, not just outward behavior. They are about values, not merely actions, because it’s commitment to shared values that allows large-scale societies to function. So it’s not enough to perform generous actions, you need to become a generous person. This is an enormously difficult trick to pull off, which is why true wu-wei is both inherently hard to reach and such a great signal of trustworthiness once we’ve managed to get there. We’re attracted to genuinely wu-wei people—they have de—because evolution has shaped us to home in on signals of sincerity that are difficult to consciously simulate and even harder to experience on demand, and to do so in response to basic challenges inherent to human cooperation.

- Fortunately for us, the early Chinese explored every conceivable strategy for moving a person from a state of alienated trying into perfected wu-wei. You can carve and polish: subject yourself to rigorous, long-term training designed to eventually instill the right dispositions. You can embrace simplicity: actively reject the pursuit of goals, in the hope that the goals will then be obtained by themselves. You can cultivate your sprouts: try to identify incipient tendencies of desirable behavior within you, and then nurture and expand them until they are strong enough to take over. Or you can just go with the flow: forget about trying, forget about not trying, and just let the values that you want to embrace pick you up and carry you along.

- “When any … act of charity or of gratitude, for instance, is presented to our sight of imagination, we are deeply impressed with its beauty and feel a strong desire in ourselves of doing charitable and grateful acts also. On the contrary, when we see or read of any atrocious deed, we are disgusted with its deformity, and conceive an abhorrence of vice. Now every emotion of this kind is an exercise of our virtuous dispositions, and dispositions, like limbs of the body, acquire strength by exercise.” Just as the four limbs of the body are strengthened by exercise, so are the four sprouts of proper wu-wei behavior nourished by the imaginative workout provided by literature. One wonders if Jefferson had been reading Mencius. ([Location 3276](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00F1W0R1O&location=3276))
- It’s in these situations—when the pressure is on and the stakes are high—that Zhuangzi’s letting-go strategy really shines. Woodcarver Qing has to engage in a weeklong ritual before he can successfully forget his body and focus his skill on the environment, and elsewhere there are suggestions that seated meditation and breathing practices are involved. It is likely that these Zhuangzian exemplars are engaged in something that looks more like the “objectless” meditation practiced in Zen, Zhuangzi’s direct religious heirs, than the visualization practices of Tibetan Buddhism. Objectless meditation typically involves assuming a simple, stable posture and then trying to empty your mind through focusing on your breath or a fixed feature in the environment.

- When it comes to essentially political decisions, however, the idea that different options can be boiled down into mathematical equations is not only misleading but positively harmful. We think in emotion-laden, embodied images, and as long as we remain oblivious to these “metaphors we live by” we remain imprisoned by them.
